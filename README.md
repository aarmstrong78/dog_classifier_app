# Dog Classifier web app

This app creates an interface for the dog classifier API I originally wrote and deployed to Wordpress.  A bootstrap carousel is used on the home page to showcase the classifications.  The API now serves up an Xception Keras model, retrained using the Stanford dog image database.

Adapted from my first web app that was written from Traversy Media YouTube tutorial.
